# Windows 11 integration: agent task and evidence record

**Date:** 3 November 2026 (Asia/Tbilisi).  
**Status:** Research recorded; earlier integration/adoption review receipts retain their original candidates. The second Microsoft Learn pass is integrated into the assignments below; its scope and evidence are recorded separately in section 4.4 onward. Source-only follow-up is ready; implementation and native qualification are unexecuted.  
**Initial inspected project baseline:** [`a6c2401b9a8166515293653f14f637e5543c689e`](https://github.com/DavidOsipov/NevroTick/tree/a6c2401b9a8166515293653f14f637e5543c689e), tree `7d0558ab295a7859e0d7d9e5b1180bea0fe30443`. This task was initially prepared from an API-derived partial snapshot, not a local Git checkout; no dirty/index/staged-state claim applies to that preparation. Later adoption and research candidates are identified in section 4.  
**Owner request:** integrate the completed Microsoft Windows 11 investigation into maintained documentation, architecture, the development plan and tasks for implementation agents.

## 1. Authority, scope and reconciliation

Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), the [documentation guide](../docs/README.md),
the [Windows 11 research](../docs/plans/windows11-integration.md), its
[Microsoft Learn follow-up](../docs/plans/windows11-integration-follow-up.md) and
[development §8.5](../docs/plans/development-plan.md#85-windows-11-integration-research-and-qualification).
The research retains primary-source contracts, proposed adaptations and support
limits; this record owns bounded assignments and subsequent execution evidence.
It does not replace the [CHECK catalog](../docs/windows-time-architecture.md#202-acceptance-catalog),
[DNS-C owners](../docs/plans/system-dns-cache-design.md#11-acceptance-cases-for-the-future-implementation)
or [ST-T owners](../docs/plans/windows-protected-storage.md#7-focused-threat-scenarios-and-acceptance-mapping).
**W11-W01–W11-W10 are task-local work labels, not new acceptance gates.**

| Reconciliation with the inspected plans | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| Clock domains, sleep invalidation, restricted identities, maintenance inhibition, DNS ownership and fixed resource limits | Retained; native mechanisms below make existing contracts and observations more concrete. |
| Packet timestamps, native DNS adapters, WSH, resource hints and CNG batches | Candidates to assess within their existing slice. Optional enhancement failure must have a truthful declared outcome; selecting none of these does not waive an existing required property. |
| Modern Standby, service-setting activation, Restart Manager and powerful process handles | Added composition cases for existing timing, service, mitigation and package owners; source documentation establishes no effective state. |
| Current development and user interface | Development §7's current portable Core checkpoint and P0–P7 order remain. UI-M0 stays fixture-only; D1, D2 and D3 remain Deferred until their existing re-entry gates. |
| DNS and storage policy | DoQ-only upstream with leaf/intermediate pins remains; no implicit DoH/DoT/DNSCrypt/plaintext fallback or ZTDNS enablement. Optional VBS/TPM/no-cache state remains separate from mandatory clock authority. |

This request authorizes documentation integration. It does not lift the current
Windows execution stop, separate fuzz no-retry hold or storage-experiment pause,
or authorize dependency acquisition, tool installation,
system configuration, keys, clock effects or service/package experiments. Future
work uses its existing applicable authorization, contract and environment gates;
this task adds no blanket approval round. Material changes to product policy or
trust boundaries use the existing owner-decision procedure, blocking only their
dependent work. Do not scaffold product code to make a planning check executable.

Use [plan-code-change](../.agents/skills/planning/plan-code-change/SKILL.md) and
the [testing contract](../.agents/skills/testing/CONTRACT.md). Select only relevant
leaves from the [skills index](../.agents/skills/README.md) and
[phase skill map](../docs/plans/development-plan.md#5-required-skill-reading-and-use-by-phase):
Rust contracts and numerical/protocol truth for timestamps; Windows service
adapters, privileges and IPC for lifecycle/identity; crypto and dependency
admission for CNG; resource QA and native-memory diagnostics for measurement;
native UI/accessibility skills only at the restored UI stage. Repository tools
and admitted profiles remain the execution authority.

## 2. Next source-only assignment

Prepare **one W11-W01 timestamp-provenance card** when the relevant acquisition
owner is assigned. This is a ready source/documentation action alongside the
existing plan, not a replacement for development §7's current portable Core
checkpoint or the engine's separately held native qualification.
Reuse the completed research; do not restart a general Windows API survey.

The card identifies the proposed producer → metadata → conversion → sample
consumer path, actual source owners where they exist, private invariants,
independent expected results and the healthy/refused traces listed below.
Separate supported build/API, runtime capability, configuration activation and
observed behavior. Leave hardware mapping and installed-token facts unresolved
where no evidence exists. Record one selected scope, finite cases/resources,
required environment and cleanup before later execution.

Carry the [second-pass packet/FFI findings](../docs/plans/windows11-integration-follow-up.md#2-packet-timestamps-socket-metadata-and-completion)
into that same card: unchanged-route timestamp-mode transitions, separate data
and control-buffer admission, and actual completion ownership if a direct
overlapped adapter is proposed. Record the documented signature/layout conflicts
as unresolved selected-SDK/binding questions; an MCP result is not an ABI test.

**Exit:** a reviewer can trace the card's timestamp identities, uncertainty,
invalidation and unsupported outcomes to the existing CHECK owners. It neither
selects hardware timing nor claims an implemented adapter. Stop at that card;
source-only uncertainty does not justify a native probe. The remaining work
items enter only when their corresponding product slice is ready.

## 3. Bounded work assignments

All implementation/qualification actions below are planned and unexecuted.
Expand only the next ready authorized item into exact writable files, candidate
identity, admitted graph/runner, case/time/resource limits and cleanup. Retain
healthy neighbors and inspect the actual enforcing consumer; a mock or Windows
cross-build does not establish native behavior. Optional experiments do not all
become prerequisites for the next time-client slice.

### W11-W01 Preserve packet timestamp provenance

**Owner/stage:** engine/platform; source card first, optional adapter in S2.1/P2.
**Prerequisites:** existing exchange, units, generation and admission contracts;
[timestamp research](../docs/plans/windows11-integration.md#1-measure-packets-closer-to-the-network-stack).

**Work:** distinguish application, software-QPC and NIC timestamps. Bind metadata
to the exchange, socket generation, actual interface and current conversion
model; qualify RX packet attribution and TX interface selection. Bound TX IDs,
retention/retrieval and missing/saturated metadata. Supported NIC capabilities,
currently enabled mode and an adequate conversion are separate conditions.
Start with software timing; hardware timing requires its own evidenced benefit.
Late TX metadata is a local measurement and cannot rewrite sent/authenticated
wire bytes. Device configuration belongs to the lifecycle owner.

**Second-pass refinement:** evaluate `RegisterInterfaceTimestampConfigChange`
as an invalidation signal even when the route/interface identity is unchanged.
Its callback supplies caller context, not the affected interface; coalesce and
re-query outside the callback. Preserve context through draining unregister,
without self-unregister or a lock needed by the callback. Notifications do not
atomically identify the mode that produced queued RX/TX metadata. Keep the
documentation's support-table differences and `VOID`/`DWORD` unregister conflict
explicit until the selected SDK/generated binding is checked.

For `WSARecvMsg`, validate payload and ancillary data independently, including
`MSG_TRUNC`/`MSG_CTRUNC`, returned lengths, control-header framing/alignment and
reinitialized capacities/flags. Dual-stack IPv4 packet information also needs
the IPv4 option. Received `IN_PKTINFO.ipi_addr` is the local destination, not
the peer. Resolve the `WSACMSGHDR.cmsg_len` overview's `UINT` versus dedicated
page's `SIZE_T` discrepancy against the actual user-mode SDK/binding; do not
hand-copy the struct. An application-timestamp fallback still needs its own
complete admission/provenance contract. For cross-thread QPC readings, retain
the documented adjacent-tick ordering ambiguity and checked conversion bounds.

If a direct overlapped socket adapter is selected, specify close/issue
serialization, socket generation, immediate/pending/terminal states and actual
completion mode, including skip-on-success. Close/cancellation does not establish
that completions were delivered; buffers and charges remain owned until their
terminal observation. This conditional contract neither establishes how dropping
a Tokio future affects native I/O nor selects a runtime rewrite. See the
[packet and completion supplement](../docs/plans/windows11-integration-follow-up.md#2-packet-timestamps-socket-metadata-and-completion).

**Controls/exit:** independent vectors and healthy application/software cases
preserve sample arithmetic. Missing metadata, stale TX IDs, socket recreation,
two interfaces with different modes, route change, counter reset and saturated
buffers cannot admit a mislabeled sample or unbounded wait. Unsupported optional
timing retains a qualified, honestly labelled application path. Later native
comparisons use controlled peers and actual NIC/build/driver evidence, without
clock writes; no UTC-accuracy improvement follows from placement alone.
Add healthy unchanged-mode and stable-route mode-change traces, queued old TX
metadata, burst/stop races, exact/one-short data and control buffers, extra
control messages and reused output fields. Where direct overlapped I/O is
selected, cover immediate success with/without skip mode, pending completion,
cancellation losing to success, close with pending work and numeric handle reuse.
**Mapping:** CHECK-6/11/21/27 for packet admission and adapter behavior;
CHECK-7/25 only for affected downstream numerical and construction invariants
at their existing phase scopes.

### W11-W02 Reconcile sleep, timers and clock presentation

**Owner/stage:** platform/clock; S0.4/P4, with DNS lifetime consumers at DNS-1/3/5.
**Prerequisites:** [clock backend](../docs/windows-time-architecture.md#10-windows-clock-backend),
owned restoration and the [sleep/timer research](../docs/plans/windows11-integration.md#sleep-timers-and-leap-presentation).

**Work:** preserve UTC, QPC and active-awake meanings. Modern Standby may suspend
services; a sleep-excluding system clock does not measure broker execution.
Recheck authoritative deadlines and generations after delayed/coalesced wakes.
No timer promises a finite lease on a programmed rate. Keep residual-rate and
unknown-cleanup outcomes, with mandatory broker work independent of optional
saves. Evaluate process leap presentation separately from global leap ownership;
high-resolution timers remain conditional on measured need.

The [follow-up](../docs/plans/windows11-integration-follow-up.md#2-packet-timestamps-socket-metadata-and-completion)
adds the actual I/O wait and unattended-resume path: an IOCP timeout can exclude
low-power time, and a dequeued batch can contain failed operations. Recheck the
authoritative deadline on execution rather than treating that timeout as elapsed
freshness. Cover unattended/automatic resume without UI activity and the
sleep-to-hibernation transition; no power callback promises execution by a deadline.

**Controls/exit:** pure traces distinguish elapsed freshness from active work;
healthy recovery accepts fresh results while stale ones fail. Later permitted
native cases cover actual S3/S4 and Modern Standby hardware, AC/DC, delayed
execution, UTC change and suspend near expiry. A generic VM does not prove
Modern Standby behavior. Observe actual adjustment mode/trajectory and cleanup
under the existing clock fixture; retain uncertain outcomes. Timer policies do
not resurrect DNS TTLs or enqueue every missed refresh. **Mapping:**
CHECK-10/11/12/21/25/27; DNS-C05/11 for affected lifetime/context consumers.

### W11-W03 Qualify native DNS ownership and coverage

**Owner/stage:** DNS/platform/lifecycle; DNS-0 contract, DNS-1 listeners,
DNS-3 native integration. **Prerequisites:**
[DNS activation/restoration](../docs/plans/system-dns-cache-design.md#23-windows-activation-ownership-and-restoration)
and [native DNS research](../docs/plans/windows11-integration.md#2-integrate-the-dns-service-without-losing-windows-policy).

**Work:** evaluate versioned Get/SetInterfaceDnsSettings with exact field masks,
allocation/lifetime owners, both address families and an ownership record.
Effective server lists do not prove DHCP inheritance; the native origin/reset
path remains unresolved until demonstrated. Acquire deliberately scoped
exclusive loopback UDP/TCP listeners before enrollment. Coalesce network
notifications into reconciliation; separately cover DNS-only/NRPT policy edits
and callback cancellation. Inventory namespace/suffix routes, host encrypted-DNS
policy, WSL tunneling, Docker's distinct path and managed ZTDNS conflicts.
`DnsQueryRaw`, settings V4 and DNR remain support-qualified candidates.

The [DNS follow-up](../docs/plans/windows11-integration-follow-up.md#5-dns-integration-and-resource-hints)
adds a selected native resolver's two completion paths: only
`DNS_REQUEST_PENDING` establishes asynchronous callback ownership. Immediate
success/failure and pending/late completion must settle once; retain pending
result/cancel/context storage until actual completion. A matching NRPT rule can
replace `DNS_QUERY_REQUEST3.pCustomServers`; an explicit server list is not
universal egress authority. Native custom-server examples do not implement the
adopted DoQ/pin transport. Keep this adapter's actual purpose and egress separate.

For interface enrollment, changing `NameServer` must preserve suffix,
registration, discovery and other unowned fields in both address families.
`EnableLLMNR` also affects mDNS; a reserved field such as
`DisableUnconstrainedQueries` is not an available security control. Privacy
descriptions distinguish NevroTick caches/statistics from the Windows DNS Client
and application caches: Forget does not erase every computer-wide DNS trace.
Do not force TTL zero or flush global caches to improve heatmap visibility.

**Controls/exit:** later disposable fixtures pair DHCP/static and IPv4/IPv6
healthy enrollment with partial writes, intervening administrator/VPN edits,
port conflicts, restart gaps, event bursts and callback-in-progress stop.
Synthetic private-name timeout/disconnect must not send that name to public
DoQ; a stable-address DNS-only edit must still invalidate affected work. Observe
declared WSL/container routing and negative LAN probes. Unsupported/ambiguous
origins and managed conflicts are explicit outcomes; never widen listeners,
disable policy or enable ZTDNS to make coverage appear complete. **Mapping:**
DNS-C01/02/03/11/17; CHECK-13/25/27 where lifecycle/adapters are affected.
The added privacy/Forget boundary uses existing DNS-C14/15. Add paired NRPT
matching/nonmatching names, immediate/pending resolver paths and an enrollment
case that preserves local discovery after an intervening administrator edit.

### W11-W04 Qualify service-scoped network restrictions

**Owner/stage:** security/lifecycle/platform; P0/P3 and installed P6 path.
**Prerequisites:** selected service identities and
[WSH research](../docs/plans/windows11-integration.md#3-constrain-service-networking-with-a-windows-owned-mechanism).

**Work:** assess `INetFwServiceRestriction` and its separate WSH rule collection
before custom WFP. Retain the restricted engine SID profile; sample parameters
are not product policy. Give broker denial and engine allowances distinct
owners, activation observations and managed-conflict outcomes. Include delegated
DNS/certificate work. Ordinary explicit firewall blocks still override ordinary
allows; they are not interchangeable with WSH defaults/exceptions.

Before selecting WSH or another COM adapter, apply the
[COM ownership contract](../docs/plans/windows11-integration-follow-up.md#3-service-lifecycle-installation-and-com):
per-thread apartment/init balance (including `S_FALSE`), process-wide security
initialization timing, interface agility/marshaling, callback direction and
release owner. An incompatible apartment or early implicit security setup is
a typed failure, not permission to relax the profile. Final `CoUninitialize`
can dispatch messages; retain shutdown guards and callback state through this
reentrant boundary. Test ordinary permitted activation under final mitigations
beside mismatched apartment, late security initialization and shutdown callback
cases. Do not add a generic COM runtime, process or broad security flags.

**Controls/exit:** actual installed identities perform approved IPv4/IPv6 work
while forbidden destinations and broker external traffic fail. Observe activation
delay, restart/update and policy conflicts, with legitimate provider operations
beside denials. A matching rule query alone proves no confinement. Custom WFP
needs a demonstrated gap and separate object ACL/transaction/session-lifetime
design; a disappearing denial after owner death is not acceptable evidence.
**Mapping:** CHECK-1/9/16/23/27, with CHECK-9 limited to delegated certificate
retrieval; DNS-C14/17 when the DNS service participates.

### W11-W05 Observe effective SCM, maintenance and process policy

**Owner/stage:** platform/security/lifecycle; P0/P3, P4 cleanup and P6 MSI.
**Prerequisites:** existing token/object, mitigation, mandatory-state and
[installation research](../docs/plans/windows11-integration.md#4-make-installation-and-service-state-reflect-actual-windows-behavior).

**Work:** record configured settings, documented activation point, actual token/
policy and pending restart/reboot separately. Qualify first installation rather
than assuming a universal reboot. Route Restart Manager starts through the same
protected maintenance/generation admission as boot, manual and SCM recovery;
public MSI properties cannot clear it. Extend child-policy observations with
harmless requests for `PROCESS_CREATE_PROCESS`/`PROCESS_VM_WRITE` on dummy peers
and inherited/duplicated-handle review. The SCM creation-policy route remains
unresolved; no custom launcher is selected. If preshutdown is used, give it an
explicit budget independent of optional cache work.

**Second-pass candidates:** evaluate declarative `MsiLockPermissionsEx` before
custom ACL actions where it expresses the required descriptor. Qualify account/
service-SID resolution and ordering, installed/reinstalled resource coverage,
parent inheritance, conflicting conditions and final owner/DACL behavior after
runtime replacement. Its formatted descriptor is not ordinary MSI-property
substitution. Inheritable parent permissions can protect later children; the
table does not reapply every individually authored descriptor to arbitrary new
objects. Inspect the actual MSI and valid/failed repair/upgrade paths.

Compare `GetServiceDirectory`/`GetServiceRegistryStateKey` only for suitably
optional/disposable state initially. Service deletion removes that state;
reboot persistence does not prove delete/recreate-upgrade survival. Do not move
mandatory correction/ownership/restoration records into it without their
existing lifecycle contract. Actual account, child-object and replacement
access still need evidence; the shared variant has different write permissions.

For a selected SCM observer, distinguish nonblocking subscription callbacks
with draining unsubscribe from one-shot APC notification/alertable-wait rules.
Coalesce and re-query outside callbacks; handle zero-mask and delete-pending
cases without deadlock or retaining handles that prevent uninstall. Neither a
notification nor SCM Running establishes authenticated product readiness.
Future UI consumers retain D2. These [lifecycle candidates](../docs/plans/windows11-integration-follow-up.md#3-service-lifecycle-installation-and-com)
reuse this owner and the existing storage task; `ReplaceFileW` failure/recovery
cases remain with [ST-W02/03](windows-protected-storage.md#st-w02-enforce-operation-outcomes-and-model-durability).

**Controls/exit:** allowed service work and private-object access succeed;
disallowed token/handle access fails under installed identities. Hold maintenance
before commit; RM/manual/queued recovery starts must not admit normal protected
work. Compare successful update, rollback, RM disabled/unavailable and honest
reboot-required outcomes. Delayed cleanup must not fabricate Stopped. Pure
lifecycle traces precede disposable native/service/MSI observations; no rights
grant is dismissed because a harmless child-launch test passed. **Mapping:**
CHECK-1/12/13/15/16/23/27; ST-T03/10/12/17 for affected storage owners.

### W11-W06 Make optional cache work resource-aware

**Owner/stage:** DNS scheduler/resource owner; DNS-4 shadow inputs, DNS-5 refresh.
**Prerequisites:** ordinary-cache baseline, fixed caps, reserved time/foreground
capacity and [resource-input research](../docs/plans/windows11-integration.md#5-make-adaptive-caching-cooperate-with-the-operating-system).

**Work:** define a small state for effective power mode, destination cost and
system memory pressure; unknown cost is not free. Coalesce level-signaled memory
notifications with hysteresis. Trim only eligible optional state; maintain
retained-reader charges, bounded scanning and allocation-error handling.
Per-thread EcoQoS is optional for suitable actual background workers, not a
process-wide setting on the time engine or a label on a shared runtime task.

Compare the [native connectivity-hint candidate](../docs/plans/windows11-integration-follow-up.md#5-dns-integration-and-resource-hints)
with COM cost tracking for the actual required input. Global/per-interface
`GetNetworkConnectivityHint*` results can avoid COM plumbing if sufficient;
they are not destination-aware `GetCost` equivalents or proof of an upstream
route. Bind observations to network generation and actual egress; coalesce
notifications and retain callback lifetime through cancellation. Unknown cost
is not free, and an Internet-status hint alone must not forbid bounded attempts
to a reachable controlled peer. Add two-interface/different-cost, route-change,
unknown-hint and stop-during-callback cases while required work still progresses.

**Controls/exit:** normal demand and required work progress under healthy states;
persistent low-memory signal, pending cost query, battery/metered transitions,
resume and allocation failure neither spin nor exceed caps. Pressure cannot
erase mandatory authority or extend answer freshness. Compare foreground/tail
latency, wakeups, CPU and energy with the existing baselines on named hardware;
no autonomous wake merely to maintain heatmaps. **Mapping:** DNS-C05/08/11/12/18;
CHECK-21/27 where shared work is affected. Native hints are not security authority.
The new hint cases primarily use DNS-C11/12/18; DNS-C08 applies only when the
selected change also affects temperature or seasonal-model behavior.

### W11-W07 Evaluate bounded CNG hash batches

**Owner/stage:** DNSSEC/crypto/performance; DNS-2 after a measured eligible queue.
**Prerequisites:** admitted validator/provider graph, independent vectors and
[CNG throughput research](../docs/plans/windows11-integration.md#6-use-native-cryptographic-acceleration-for-a-measured-workload).

**Work:** compare the admitted backend with `BCryptCreateMultiHash` for eligible
independent SHA-256/384/512 inputs; cache appropriate provider handles only under
the existing algorithm/lifetime policy. SIMD batching is separate from bounded
multicore scheduling and does not accelerate all signature, TLS, NTS or AEAD
operations. Do not delay an isolated foreground request to fill a batch or use
this candidate to decide the still-open crypto graph implicitly.

**Controls/exit:** independent known-answer and accepted/rejected validation
neighbors agree across selected paths. Small/empty/partial workloads, hostile
work, cancellation and provider failures retain fair admission and real custody.
Measure tail latency, throughput, CPU and energy on supported CPU/OS rows before
adoption. No benefit, capability absence or unacceptable latency can leave this
candidate deferred while required DNSSEC acceleration/multicore work retains its
owner. **Mapping:** DNS-C04/12/16; CHECK-20/21/25/26/27 as applicable. Hash evidence
does not qualify optional-storage roots or a different cryptographic operation.

### W11-W08 Trace native behavior and qualify one fault profile

**Owner/stage:** diagnostics/QA and the affected component's existing phase.
**Prerequisites:** typed redaction/session policy and
[diagnostic research](../docs/plans/windows11-integration.md#7-diagnose-actual-windows-behavior-and-inject-native-failures).

**Work:** use monotonic IDs/times to correlate packet, queue, verification,
selection, broker admission and actual acknowledgement with WPR/WPA. Record ETW
loss; missing trace events cannot prove absence and traces cannot replace the
durable journal. PerfLib V2 aggregate counters are optional coarse monitoring.
For one named low-resource question, first admit its exact Application Verifier
profile and healthy/deliberate-failure controls under the existing tool policy.
Current Basics/full PageHeap admission does not admit arbitrary extra profiles;
the `/faults` shortcut is not coverage of every native resource failure.

The [diagnostics follow-up](../docs/plans/windows11-integration-follow-up.md#4-diagnostics-replacement-and-protected-storage)
adds multiple-controller qualification. ETW enable/keyword interest is aggregated
and cannot authorize or extend product verbose diagnostics. Retain the local
authorization/expiry guard independently of controller-supplied `SourceId`;
`GUID_NULL` is a GUID value, not a nullable-pointer contract. Capture-state follows
the same field/resource policy. Provider registration/enable rights, session
control/consumer rights and ETL-file access/retention are separate observations.
The local guard bounds emission; it does not make events exclusive to one
matching session or recall already collected ETL data.

Exercise two controllers with different filters, expiry while one remains,
capture-state and provider restart; required-event routing remains useful and
synthetic secrets remain absent. For crash privacy, identify each collector:
process WER/NOHEAP choices do not establish control of independent LocalDumps or
every debugger path. Reuse [ST-W07](windows-protected-storage.md#st-w07-verify-sensitive-memory-lifetime-and-actual-output-privacy)
for admitted dummy-secret checks; do not alter administrator dump policy here.

**Controls/exit:** actual allowed diagnostics remain useful and synthetic secret/
domain markers remain absent. Trace loss is reported. A selected allocation,
handle, registration or CNG failure reaches the intended refusal/cleanup owner
without half-applied effects or false Running. Restore the owned per-image
profile on every exit and inspect cleanup before harness teardown. Instrumented
fault discovery and uninstrumented resource measurements remain separate.
**Mapping:** CHECK-1/17/21/27, with CHECK-1 limited to diagnostic access;
ST-T14/16 and DNS-C12/14 for affected storage/DNS paths.

### W11-W09 Add truthful native notifications at the deferred UI stage

**Owner/stage:** UI/accessibility; P5 after the relevant D2/D3 re-entry gate.
**Prerequisites:** actual authenticated service snapshots, restored deferred
contracts and [native UI research](../docs/plans/windows11-integration.md#8-present-live-state-through-native-ui-facilities).

**Work:** evaluate `UiaRaiseNotificationEvent` and supported processing modes for
meaningful state changes; ordinary ticking status must not create important
announcement spam. Local Windows App SDK notifications are a separate candidate
with deployment/dependency cost; unpackaged support does not remove that review
or justify package identity automatically. Keep presentation unelevated and
revalidate current generation/authority at every notification action.
Any selected UI COM class also uses W11-W04's class-specific apartment,
security-initialization and teardown contract; this does not restore D2/D3 early.

**Controls/exit:** meaningful current loss/recovery or optional-cache status is
announced accurately; stale events, rapid repetition and expired actions cannot
mislead or authorize protected effects. Observe actual Narrator/keyboard behavior
on the selected build, including a compatible older processing mode where
required. The build-26100 enum choice is not the base API floor or accessibility
proof. **Mapping:** CHECK-14/17/22; ST-T01/14 when storage status/privacy is reached.
UI-M0 D1/D2/D3 remain Deferred; this task activates none of them.

### W11-W10 Re-enter conditional mechanisms only for a concrete need

The [conditional research](../docs/plans/windows11-integration.md#9-conditional-mechanisms-worth-understanding)
and [second-pass reserves](../docs/plans/windows11-integration-follow-up.md#6-conditional-mechanisms)
own source contracts and limits. These reserves are not a prerequisite list.

| Reserve / existing owner | Re-entry condition and bounded exit |
| --- | --- |
| Job Objects or SCM triggers / platform | A measured optional-role resource/activation need; compare healthy useful work with limit exhaustion, stopping/maintenance races and owner death. Preserve independent broker cleanup; an address or endpoint trigger is not Internet readiness or first-UDP/53 activation. |
| LPAC/AppContainer or preview Win32 app isolation / architecture/security | A named untrusted-work boundary justifies capabilities, IPC, supported launch/deployment and lifetime costs. Observe actual denied access beside admitted work; standalone creation APIs do not prove SCM compatibility. No new privileged broker follows automatically. |
| Stricter CET/EHCONT / build/security | A selected mitigation property for the exact Rust/native closure; inspect metadata and actual enforcement beside legitimate provider/callback behavior. Existing CHECK-16/20/26 owners remain. |
| Full VBS enclave / storage/release | A secret operation needs enclave execution beyond isolated CNG roots. Separate runtime build/VBS/HVCI from development/signing eligibility, and use the existing storage task and ST-T11/12/13; the native storage pause remains. |
| External-location identity or WinGet / UI/packaging | A named identity-dependent feature or qualified distribution need. Keep one complete MSI, profile-specific trust and multi-user repair/removal; existing CHECK-18/23 own final-package evidence. Local notifications alone do not select identity or another updater. |
| W32Time provider DLL / architecture/clock | An explicitly different Windows-managed-discipline goal. First reconcile controller ownership, trust and restoration in a source-only decision card; never add it as a competing controller. Existing CHECK-5/10/13 remain. |
| VBS key claims / storage/security | Actual-key origin evidence is the named blocking question. The new `NCryptCreateClaim`/`NCryptVerifyClaim` extensions are prerelease; the base API floor does not qualify them. Define trusted anchor, subject/freshness binding, replay/version/debug/update policy and attestation-key/hash/padding prerequisites. Do not add roles to wrapping/signing roots or adopt a new root, cloud service or hardware rollback claim. Reuse the storage reserve and ST-T01/05/13. |
| Side-channel policy fields / per-process security | A named threat, process role and supported hardware/build justify one field. Account for irreversible enablement, scheduler dependencies and common-page exceptions; readback is not an enforcement measurement. Compare healthy timing/crypto/IPC and CPU/energy costs under CHECK-16/21, without raising privileges or enabling every bit. |
| UDP coalescing/segmentation / selected transport | A measured bottleneck justifies a backend/option comparison, such as future DoQ. Prove original datagram boundaries, short-final-segment and missing/truncated-control outcomes, per-datagram accounting and timestamp attribution. This is not DNS request coalescing or a reason to change NTP defaults/global offloads; existing CHECK-6/21/25/27 and affected DNS-C12 apply. |
| VM Generation ID / clock/security | A restore-witness need has a supported privilege design. The documented admin/SYSTEM device access is not permission to broaden engine/broker accounts. Cover missing/access-denied device, stale read/change, restore and cancellation; a witness cannot reset consumed authority or prove a trustworthy boot counter. Reuse CHECK-11/12/15/27. |

Protected Process Light is excluded as a normal utility-service option; ordinary
publisher signing supplies no protected-service eligibility. No reserve selects
a dependency, weaker fallback, service topology or machine-wide policy here.

## 4. Evidence and continuation

| Evidence layer | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft source investigation and critical source/fit review | Completed research retained in the linked document; documentation facts and engineering inferences are distinguished. No native experiments were executed. |
| Documentation, architecture, plan and task integration | Earlier integration and local-adoption review/validation retain the candidates in sections 4.1–4.3. The current second-pass integration is recorded separately from section 4.4; earlier passes do not qualify changed text. |
| W11-W01 source contract | Ready bounded next action when assigned to the relevant acquisition owner; not executed by this integration. |
| Portable implementation/model | No W11 work-item, CHECK, DNS-C or ST-T implementation pass established by this integration. |
| Native Windows/service identity | Unexecuted; the current Windows execution stop, storage-experiment pause and applicable environment/authorization gates remain. The separate fuzz no-retry hold is also unchanged. |
| Installed MSI and release | Unexecuted; installed-path, final dependency/artifact and release evidence retain their existing owners. |

For later work, record the selected item and existing acceptance IDs, exact
source/configuration/graph/candidate, writable owner, admitted runner/environment,
independent expectations, healthy/failure controls, finite limits and actual
results. Preserve failures, skips, unsupported/conflict outcomes and cleanup.
Source review, model execution, cross-build, native observation and installed
package evidence answer different questions; never promote one to another.
Recheck only affected evidence when the relevant bytes, provider, account,
Windows build, device/driver, policy or package change. Continue in this record
and the existing owning task rather than starting a parallel plan.

### 4.1 Integration review and documentation validation receipt

**Stage and outcome:** independent review completed; **READY for the
owner-authorized documentation integration/publication stage**. Reviewer
`windows_integration_publish_review` had fresh context (`fork_turns: none`),
read-only candidate access and no authorship of these files. The reviewer used
the current repository `plan-independent-review` skill, read both new documents
in full and all meaningful changes in the eight existing files, and checked
phase/acceptance mappings against their existing owners. No unresolved finding
remains within that scope.

**Reviewed identity:** baseline commit
`a6c2401b9a8166515293653f14f637e5543c689e`, tree
`7d0558ab295a7859e0d7d9e5b1180bea0fe30443`; ten-file review manifest SHA-256
`eae0d60fba76668a8d8a61cf59d04d8c769b52c2283d7c969e7810ef4c0fbc10`. The reviewer
independently recomputed all ten byte counts, SHA-256 and Git blob hashes:
ten matches, zero mismatches. Exact reviewed file identities follow. The task
identity is **before this administrative receipt and status amendment**; the
other nine files retain their reviewed bytes.

**Reviewer comprehension, preserved verbatim:**

> The change retains Windows 11 research as a source-attributed proposal and distributes its concrete future checks into existing platform, DNS, storage, diagnostic and UI owners. W11-W labels locate bounded assignments; they must not create new canonical acceptance IDs or adopt an API, runtime dependency, security profile, release channel or service topology.
>
> The inspected baseline has pure/fixture time components plus a bounded observation engine; production services, whole-computer DNS and protected optional storage largely remain plans. S1.3 remains next, UI-M0 remains fixture-only with D1/D2/D3 deferred, and native/storage experiments remain paused. One complete MSI, least-privilege engine/broker separation, DoQ-only pins, and mandatory clock state separate from optional cache remain controlling constraints.

**Findings and disposition:**

- **W11-IR-01 — low, fixed and independently verified.** The WSH hardening row
  referred to CHECK-8, whose canonical subject is duplicate sources/minimum
  agreement. Replaced that unrelated mapping with CHECK-9 explicitly limited to
  delegated certificate retrieval; W11-W04 and development section 8.5 carry the
  same qualification.
- **W11-IR-02 — low, fixed and independently verified.** W11-W01 and development
  section 8.5 omitted CHECK-6's packet-admission owner. Both now include it;
  CHECK-7/25 apply only to affected downstream numerical/construction invariants.

**Coordinator validation:** scoped documentation checks passed for exactly ten
Markdown files. The checked scope is changed lines in existing files and new
documents in full: 64 distinct introduced local links/anchors resolve against
the complete pinned tree and actual candidate/base bytes; 69 new source
reference definitions are complete and distinct; six GitHub source links retain
pinned blob revisions. No missing anchor-source bytes, reference errors,
UTF-8/replacement-character, final-newline or changed-line whitespace defects
remain. The development plan's entire section 7, all 27 CHECK catalog rows and
all 18 DNS-C acceptance rows are byte-identical to baseline; the architecture's
REQ/BND/DEC/THR/CHECK/ST-T identifier set is unchanged. W11-W01 through W11-W10
each have exactly one work-item heading. The scoped validator is rerun on the
final receipt-bearing candidate before publication. No root documentation
checksum manifest exists in the inspected tree; separate design manifests were
outside this change.

**Limits and continuation:** the completed source/fit research was reused; this
integration review was not another exhaustive Microsoft API or external-link
availability audit. Review and documentation checks establish no Rust, Windows,
service, installer, storage, performance or accessibility result. The coordinator
reconciles only this factual receipt/status delta with the completed review, then
checks expected-head concurrency and exact published paths/blob identities.
Substantive changes reopen the affected review conclusion. W11-W01's source card
and all implementation/native assignments above remain unexecuted.

### 4.2 Local checkout adoption — 3 November 2026

David requested the same pull and task-adoption procedure as the preceding
storage update. Local `main` fast-forwarded from `a6c2401` to `f163c19`.
All 120 staged paths were preserved. Three overlapping routing documents
(`AGENTS.md`, the documentation guide and development plan) were merged
additively; current Windows/fuzz stops, the storage queue, Core checkpoints,
detailed phase gates and historical review receipts remain. The source/API
review in section 4.1 applies to its original candidate, not this merged checkout.

At its next checkpoint, the primary development coordinator reads
[development §7](../docs/plans/development-plan.md#7-next-executable-task-for-a-development-agent)
and [§8.5](../docs/plans/development-plan.md#85-windows-11-integration-research-and-qualification),
records each applicable W11 assignment's owner, disposition and next action here,
and carries its contracts into the owning task before dependent implementation.
The existing ST-W01–ST-W07 queue stays separate. This is a discoverable handoff;
acknowledgement by a separately running agent is pending its next checkpoint.

Initial dispositions: W11-W01 is ready for one source-only timestamp-provenance
card when assigned to the acquisition owner, alongside the existing product
priority. W11-W02–W11-W08 remain planned at their named phases and prerequisites,
with Windows observations held; W11-W07 also requires an evidenced eligible
workload. W11-W09 remains deferred until its existing live-UI/accessibility
triggers. W11-W10 remains a conditional reserve. Optional candidates are not
silently selected by adopting an assignment; existing required properties and
CHECK/DNS-C/ST-T ownership remain binding.

Current Core work continues from the S150 task addendum, which records the
fitted-anchor bridge's development pass and remaining projection qualification;
do not repeat its preceding source-only assignment. No Core source or evidence
was changed by this documentation handoff. The broad Windows execution stop,
separate fuzz no-retry hold, storage-experiment pause, DoQ-only policy, complete
MSI, process/mandatory-state boundaries and UI-M0 deferrals remain in force.
No tool/dependency/provider, hardware timestamp path, new analyzer profile or
distribution channel is admitted. New handoff edits remain unstaged.

Local documentation checks and the new combined-candidate review follow below;
neither this handoff nor its review establishes implemented/native behavior.

### 4.3 Combined local-candidate review and validation

**3 November 2026:** `windows11_adoption_final_review`, delegated read-only with
`fork_turns: "none"`, completed the combined routing review. Verdict: **ready for
this source-only adoption stage**, with no material findings. Its comprehension
is retained verbatim:

> The change makes the imported Windows 11 research discoverable through startup instructions → development §7/§8.5 → the existing W11 task. W11-W01 is a bounded source-only assignment for the acquisition owner; W11-W02–08 retain their phase prerequisites and Windows hold, W11-W09 remains deferred, and W11-W10 remains conditional. Publishing this routing does not claim acknowledgement by the separately running AI.

> Current execution remains governed by the existing Core task and holds. The §7 S150 pointer matches the actual task: the fitted-anchor bridge has a portable development pass, with projection qualification still outstanding. The ST-W queue, Windows stop, separate fuzz hold, storage pause, DoQ-only policy, complete MSI and UI-M0 boundaries remain intact. Optional APIs, providers and dependency graphs remain unselected.

The four-file pre-receipt manifest SHA-256 is
`910226768a20117df4f996e677941f4b3ba3faf9db62f1df217da80caab722d5`.
It binds `AGENTS.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/plans/development-plan.md` and this
task before adding this subsection. All four file hashes matched during review;
this factual receipt is a subsequent addition, not a reviewed implementation.

Local checks resolved 796 link/anchor occurrences across the ten imported/current
documents, found no conflict markers and passed routing whitespace checks.
All 117 nonoverlapping staged entries retain their original blob/mode/stage;
three overlapping documents were merged additively. The staged path set remains
120 and the preserved post-pull index is unchanged. Concurrent Core work remains
owned by its existing agent. No product build, analyzer campaign or Windows
operation was run for this pull/adoption task. No root documentation checksum
manifest is present. New routing edits remain unstaged.

Continuation remains the coordinator acknowledgement and owner/disposition/next
action record in section 4.2, alongside the active S150 qualification. No W11
implementation or native result is credited by this documentation review.

### 4.4 Microsoft Learn second-pass integration — 3 November 2026

David requested the completed second investigation be entered into documentation.
The source investigation compared the published `f163c193b0bb4167ec5c39e16b1db1b581509750`
baseline. This integration instead starts from current GitHub main
`45ff247d84e5e43bd13f54de1c84aa13ce2e6efd`, tree
`6fccf094d8eae9d8dbccfb406afed0e08e2b11f9`, after the intervening code/test and
local-adoption commit. It uses an API-derived partial snapshot, not a local Git
checkout; earlier index/staged-state observations in sections 4.2–4.3 are
historical and do not describe this workspace.

The [follow-up source record](../docs/plans/windows11-integration-follow-up.md)
retains the Microsoft Learn MCP evidence, engineering adaptations and research
review corrections. The assignments above now include timestamp configuration
notifications, ancillary-data/ABI boundaries, conditional socket completion,
COM ownership, service-state lifetime, declarative MSI ACLs, SCM subscriptions,
native connectivity hints, DNS completion/policy/field preservation, ETW
controller/access separation and collector-specific privacy. `ReplaceFileW`
post-failure reconciliation stays with ST-W02/03. VBS key claims, side-channel
fields, UDP batching and VM generation remain conditional reserves.

This extends existing work items and acceptance ownership rather than adopting
those APIs or opening another task chain. Documentation contradictions remain
explicit selected-SDK/binding questions. Reuse the completed research when the
acquisition owner prepares the one W11-W01 source card; do not count this import
as that card's execution or restart a general survey.

The current portable Core checkpoint in development §7, imported ST-W queue,
Windows execution stop, separate fuzz no-retry hold and storage pause remain.
W11-W02–08 retain their named phase/prerequisite gates; W11-W09 retains D2/D3 and
W11-W10 its specific re-entry triggers. DoQ-only pins, complete MSI, selected
service roles and separate mandatory clock state remain. The source/fit review
from the investigation does not qualify these edited files; integrated review
and documentation checks are recorded separately after the candidate is frozen.
No product, native, SDK/ABI, MSI, security-tool or performance result is claimed.

### 4.5 Second-pass integrated review and documentation validation

**3 November 2026:** `/root/wlearn_docs_independent_review`, delegated read-only
with `fork_turns: "none"`, completed review of the frozen twelve-document
candidate. Verdict: **ready for this documentation integration stage; no material
findings**. It checked all introduced clauses and the full new supplement against
surrounding canonical owners, raw Microsoft evidence and current task boundaries.
A separate fresh-context helper checked the DNS sources; three targeted complete
Microsoft pages resolved missing raw-page coverage. No broad survey or native
execution was repeated. Its two comprehension paragraphs are retained verbatim:

> The proposed change incorporates the second Microsoft Learn investigation into NevroTick's maintained documentation and its existing W11 and storage assignments. It adds specific API transitions, source discrepancies and future healthy/refused cases to the existing technical and qualification owners. It does not select the optional mechanisms, execute the source cards or turn research into implementation evidence.

> The relevant current system has portable Rust Core work in progress while Windows execution, the separately held fuzz runner and storage experiments remain stopped. The proposed production design separates the network-facing engine, narrow clock broker, ordinary-user UI and lifecycle helper within one complete MSI. Optional NTS/DNS persistence remains separate from mandatory clock continuity; future DNS retains DoQ-only upstream with leaf/intermediate pins, and UI-M0's D1/D2/D3 work remains deferred.

The reviewed manifest SHA-256 is
`2654e3b5c2b5afea59a18ba0fc1c5566c6e9cd87882dbe2ccd2992d84983768e`.
The completed raw review SHA-256 is
`c3c99b0aa9af4ae1adf9b58fa4bcb076f00bd50d157345914dc1c9e412eeb3f1`.
The reviewer independently matched each candidate's byte count, SHA-256 and Git
blob hash. The following hashes identify the pre-receipt files; this factual
subsection is a later addition to the task, not a reviewed implementation.

The coordinator's scoped documentation check passed all 54 distinct introduced
local source/target/anchor combinations, checked the new supplement's 53 used
Microsoft source references and found no unresolved reference, conflict marker
or invalid added whitespace. The reviewer independently resolved 71 introduced
local-link occurrences covering those 54 combinations. These counts describe
the frozen candidate before this receipt; they are not full-repository or remote
availability checks. All 53 source URLs are distinct Microsoft Learn pages.

Both checks preserve all 27 CHECK rows, 18 DNS-C rows and 18 ST-T rows, the whole
current development §7, and the W11 task §§4.1–4.3/storage task §§6.1–6.4 historical
receipts. Current `main` was rechecked at `45ff247` before review. No root
`docs/SHA256SUMS.txt` exists; no bundle-integrity result is claimed. The candidate
contains only the twelve Markdown paths above, including one new source supplement.

Review scope excludes unrelated old claims, actual SDK headers, application
implementation conformance and all native service/filesystem/COM/ETW/DNS/MSI
behavior. The source discrepancies and selected-build/provider questions remain
future evidence under their existing owners. No Rust build, analyzer/fuzz campaign,
Windows operation, package, clock, key or dependency change was executed here.

The coordinator rechecks the appended receipt and uses an expected-head,
non-force publication with exact path/blob verification. A substantive later edit
reopens only its affected review conclusions. W11-W01's source card, ST-W01 and
later implementation/native assignments remain unexecuted by this integration;
current Core work and every recorded execution hold remain controlling.
